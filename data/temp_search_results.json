    "content": ":: EM U4 p32 Review 2 OpenCloze :: Read the text below and think of the word which best fits each gap. Use only one word in each gap. // There is an example at the beginning. More than just a pretty face? There are many stories of dolphins helping people in trouble, { 1: SA : = like } saving swimmers from shark attacks by gathering round them or shepherding them to safety. { 1: SA : = If } these stories are true, why do dolphins do it and { 1: SA : = what } makes them behave in this way? Scientists { 1: SA : = who ~ = that } have studied them are not entirely sure. For dolphins to act together as a group to save humans implies that { 1: SA : = there } is some sort of code of ethics among dolphins, but there is little evidence for that. The { 1: SA : = most } likely explanation is that they instinctively respond to the appearance of predators like sharks by herding weaker members of their own group into { 1: SA : = a } safe place - and there is proof that dolphins do cooperate with { 1: SA : = each ~ = each other } other to ward off danger. Maybe they just mistake swimmers for part of their group, which would mean that dolphins don’t have genuine feelings of kindness towards humans. { 1: SA : = It } may be that their smiling appearance simply gives people the wrong idea. // Part 3: Word formation :: EM U4 p33 Review 3 Word formation :: Read the text below. Use the word given in capitals to form a word that fits in the gap in the same line. // There is an example at the beginning (0). Why do they do it? People are attracted to attempting extreme activities for a { 1: SA : = variety } (VARY) of reasons. Some enjoy the challenge, others the feeling of { 1: SA : = excitement } (EXCITE) they get from testing themselves. So although their actual { 1: SA : = motivation } (MOTIVATE) may differ, people who participate in extreme sports probably share an inability to accept all the { 1: SA : = limits } (LIMIT) that most of us think of as normal. They experience a sense of { 1: SA : = dissatisfaction } ( SA TISFY) with the routine of everyday life, and feel a need to push the boundaries of what is possible, to see how far they can go. Is this similar to simply being { 1: SA : = competitive } (COMPETE)? Possibly, but it may be more to do with having a dream. Of course { 1: SA : = professional } (PROFESSION) athletes who train for extreme events like the triathlon or the marathon may hope for { 1: SA : = financial } (FINANCE) rewards, but primarily it seems they like being different. They enjoy the feeling of being set apart from other people by their { 1: SA : = achievements } (ACHIEVE), which are things most of us would fear to do. // Part 4: Key word transformation :: EM U4 p33 Review 4.0 Key word transformation :: Complete the second sentence so that it has a similar meaning to the first sentence, using the word given.

    "statement": "// U5 p36-37 Reading You are going to read an article about a woman who tried out a new kind of food. Read the text once quickly and answer the first question below. Last week, I posted a picture of my supper on Facebook. Never before has a post about a meal drawn so much controversy from friends. The reason? I was about to tuck into some Huel, a vegan powdered food that claims to contain everything the body needs, according to current government guidelines on nutrition.  The instructions suggest adding some flavour when you start and to introduce Huel slowly. I blended three scoops with 550ml of water and a banana: a ‘meal’, according to the packet, and the equivalent of eating a sandwich. The first gulp of creamy, vanilla-tasting liquid seemed harmless, but the following sips got smaller as I struggled to swallow it and couldn’t finish, mainly because I found it so filling. Not eating felt strange but I went to bed feeling satisfied and with no ill effects. Ordinarily, I eat very healthy meals, so I notice when I’ve consumed any kind of junk but not with Huel, despite feeling rather worried when I looked at the lists on the label. The main ingredients are oats, pea protein, brown rice protein and flaxseeds followed by what looked like a load of chemicals. [line 38] According to Julian Hearn these provide vitamins and minerals.</p Over the first few days, I hated the sugary smell of Huel and its sweet taste, [line 40] but by the end of the week, I’d got the hang of it: one meal a day, best consumed for breakfast. I found it really useful during a busy working week. It was highly convenient having my dishwasher virtually unused and my rubbish bin empty. Besides, because I intentionally restricted my calorie intake to rid my body of some excess weight I’d put on over Christmas, by the end of the week I had lost 3 kilos. Week two was harder. On two Huel meals a day I started to really miss eating. I love cooking and eating is a highly social occasion for me. But when I did sit down to a proper meal, I savoured every single mouthful. Huel had heightened my appreciation for food. Most encouragingly though, I was feeling great. There was no difference in energy levels at the gym and my body tolerated it well.  ",
